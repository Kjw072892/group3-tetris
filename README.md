Agenda #4: Draft a basic outlines on what our tetris board will look like.


## Sprint 1 Contribution
For sprint 1, we were able to get together and present our own vision and ideas on what our project would look like at 
the end of sprint 1. On the first day we were able to code with each other, trying out each other's ideas on creating
a basic layout of our tetris game board.
During this same meeting, we agreed on who would do what, and what the result should look like.

## Kassie 
Kassie was responsible for creating the ScorePanel class and DirectionLabel class. 
She also helped with refactoring code for potential reusability, clarity, 
and making sure that checkstyle warnings were cleared.
She also created a utility class that takes in any number of JLabels, extracts the labels font attributes, 
and concatenates the labels together; such that each section of the output string would have the same font data as the 
labels that were passed, and that-string would then be used to create the new JLabel text.
She also helped design an outline of the game board. 
She also added two JMenuItems "Feature" and "Help" where the Feature item will store different game background music, 
and background colors, and the Help item will store the "about" and other possible helpful instructions.
