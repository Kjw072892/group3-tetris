## Sprint 3 Meeting Agenda


## Sprint 3 Contribution
For sprint 3, we updated the scoring algorithm, we created an adBanner that shows ads made by Kassie, Roman, and Zainab. 
We also created sound fx by using existing tetris sound fx files. 
Roman, Kassie, and Zainab also created different themes and added different background music that the user can choose.
We also fixed a ton of checkstyle warnings, reorganized our code. 

## Kassie 
Kassie was in charge of creating the score panel, control instructions panel, and to create some ad banners. 
She also created the in game file menu, and she created the About file menu item and the control scheme file menu item.
Kassie also created the in game sound fx. 
She found a tetris sound fx file online, and she selected which sounds would be appropriate for our game. 
She also wrote up the scoring algorithm so that it uses the algorithm given to us in the API. 
Lastly, she was involved in the decision of finalizing the overall layout and the Frame theme.
