## Sprint 0 Contribution
For sprint 0, we were able to get together on Wednesday and introduced ourselves to each other.
We were able to complete all agenda items during our in-person meeting.
Later in the evening we got together again virtually and worked on part-B for about 1.5-2 hours.
James, Kassie, Roman, and Zainab were able to figure out the basic functionality of Git, GitHub, and intellij's Git 
functionality.
Each of us made commits, merge-request, pull-requests, by editing the readme.md file in the group3-tetris project
repository. 

## Kassie 
Responsible for setting-up the repository and guided the team through the git flow and functionality. 
Also assisted with general discussions when the group was still learning the API. Created the Switch/Case expression
that performed an actions based on the user's input (the piece movement). Assisted with the Java Doc and the java comments. Kassie also
assisted in de-bugging and the creation of the general format of the Main class. 

## James 
Ensured that pause was functioning in correctly. Also made a function to make the console
clear out a new space for the current frame of the game upon every command. Contributed towards allowing the other game
commands work through different directions of movement (with the switch expression). Clarified to the group how the tetris 
game object shall be instantiated and worked on the "puzzle pieces" of the working project. Lastly also ensured
the proper order of method calls are made so that game loops from top to bottom, analogous to that of what a
worker should do first in a job.

## Roman
Responsible for troubleshooting issues that came up during the integration. 
he organized troubleshooting sessions, where we all worked together to resolve the issues. This 
helped ensure our game was stable and ready for further development. Provided final checks and revisions, 
cleaning up the final result of sprint 0.

## Zainab 
Assisted wih improving the game logic and was the one who found the game's pause-toggle 
feature in the API documentation, which helped with implement proper pause functionality.
She also proposed the idea of using a do-while loop to control the game loop.
Zainab was responsible for the majority of the JavaDoc.

On 02/21/25 we completed part-C of the sprint 0. 

## Sprint 0 Comments

- API Integration: We worked together and discussed our review of API documentation to better understand the API methods 
and their functionality. 
- User Interface: The console was functioning well, however we faced some challenges with feedback that the game
was paused. As a team, we figured out how to display the paused message such that on successive prints,
there is feedback that the game is paused.
- Team Collaboration: Overall, Our team worked cohesively, balancing both in person and remote efforts.
