## Sprint 0 Contribution
For sprint 0, we were able to get together on wednesday and introduced ourselves to each other. 
We were able to complete all agenda items during our in person meeting.
Later in the evening we got together again virtually and worked on part-B. James, Kassie, Roman, and Zainab were 
able to figure out the basic functionality of Git, GitHub, and intellij's Git functionality.
Each of us made commits, merge-request, pull-requests, editing the readme.md file in the group3-tetris project 
repository.
