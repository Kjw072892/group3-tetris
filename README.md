## Sprint 1 Meeting Agenda
Agenda #1: Determine who's responsible for which part for sprint 1.

Agenda #2: Discuss basic project requirements for sprint 1.

and setting up for sprint 2 and beyond.

Agenda #4: Draft a basic outlines on what our tetris board will look like.


## Sprint 1 Contribution
For sprint 1, we were able to get together and present our own vision and ideas on what our project would look like at 
the end of sprint 1. On the first day we were able to code with each other, trying out each other's ideas on creating
a basic layout of our tetris game board.
During this same meeting, we agreed on who would do what, and what the result should look like.

## Kassie 
Kassie was responsible for creating the ScorePanel class and DirectionLabel class. 
She also helped with refactoring code for potential reusability, clarity, 
and making sure that checkstyle warnings were cleared.
She also created a utility class that takes in any number of JLabels, extracts the labels font attributes, 
and concatenates the labels together; such that each section of the output string would have the same font data as the 
labels that were passed, and that-string would then be used to create the new JLabel text.
She also helped design an outline of the game board. 
She also added two JMenuItems "Feature" and "Help" where the Feature item will store different game background music, 
and background colors, and the Help item will store the "about" and other possible helpful instructions.

## James 
James had worked on getting the FileMenu class started so that a new game can be started, can exit the program, and having an about page. He had also worked on making the nextPiece Gui componenet working, ensuring that every tetromino that gets inputted is centered on the spot. He also helped Zainab with bugfixing the problem of the game screen not displaying the tetrominos correctly on the start screen. James also made sure to listen to feedback of Roma, particulary on how to find the center of a tetromino piece on a cartesian coordinate graph. James lastly did project management on what should get done.
