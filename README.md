## Sprint 2 Meeting Agenda
[Sprint2 SCRUM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ym6V50Ek3UeEYz6Bx8C-IV6a5gg_2qsMza1JJ3IMQBc/edit?usp=sharing)


## Sprint 1 Contribution
For sprint 2, we were tasked to make the game board functional by implementing property change listeners.
Roman was in charge of overseeing the final production of our code for sprint 2, Kassie was in charge of creating the SCRUM document, and to be acting scribe of the SCRUM meeting. 
She was also responsible for adding change listeners to the score panel. Zainab was responsible for making necessary changes to her game board code production, while also implementing property change listeners. James was responsible for implementing the property change listeners for next-piece.

## Kassie 
Kassie and the rest of the members worked cohesively together 
to come up with the design layout of our code to implement the property change listeners. 
She struggled with the conception of property change listeners, and Roman and James guided her through it. 
She was responsible for implementing what she learned about property change listeners to the Score panel, 
even though it's not a requirement for sprint 3. She still hasn't gotten the score to increment yet, 
so she will be responsible for seeing that through in sprint 3. She did however layout the property change listener foundation for the score panel, so now all she has to do is to get the labels to change when a player scores by clearing a line. 
She and Roman made the game logic class that produces these changes.

## James 
James implemented property change listener into gameboard and nextpiece. He also made the filemenu be able to start a game once a button inside there is clicked to "start game". He then also made sure the nextpiece panel properly draws whatever next piece gets thrown by property changes. He also had fixed a big where gameboard wouldn't properly draw the frozen pieces upon start of the game, and the gameboard functions properly.

## Roman
Implemented the key handling, specifically via the `InputMap` and `ActionMap` API of Swing JComponents. Implemented, 
with the help of Kassie, the `GameLogic` class that handles the game logic. Worked with Kassie to improve
the `ScorePanel` class.
