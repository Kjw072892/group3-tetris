## Sprint 3 Meeting Agenda
[Sprint3 SCRUM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uMo-cxY1tNU1H5duFhw1mXEeVkjqPRwN_DeSIhanTlY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5yd95uxiv8hb)

## Sprint 3 Contribution
For sprint 3, we updated the scoring algorithm, we created an adBanner that shows ads made by Kassie, Roman, and Zainab. 
We also created sound fx by using existing tetris sound fx files. 
Roman, Kassie, and Zainab also created different themes and added different background music that the user can choose.
We also fixed a ton of checkstyle warnings, reorganized our code. 

## Kassie 
Kassie was in charge of creating the score panel, control instructions panel, and to create some ad banners. 
She also created the in game file menu, and she created the About file menu item and the control scheme file menu item.
Kassie also created the in game sound fx. 
She found a tetris sound fx file online, and she selected which sounds would be appropriate for our game. 
She also wrote up the scoring algorithm so that it uses the algorithm given to us in the API. 
Lastly, she was involved in the decision of finalizing the overall layout and the Frame theme.

## James 
James contributed by adding in a game over screen and pause screen. James also added in the backend to add 
functionality of a panic mode. He also then used the backend to make front end changes to make the background
darker if the pieces go over a certain height. He also helped fix a couple of checkstyle errors. He added in
a game over effect where the background flashes a color.

## Roman
Finalized the manager classes. Created a drawing manager/factory with a functional interface `DrawingObject` to make it easier to 
draw blocks on the game board and the panel for the next piece. Debugged audio stuff, fixed bug where music would play if you
hit unmute and the game was over or paused. Worked with Kassie to implement the ad panel. Provided insight on
some programming styles.

## Zainab 
Zainab worked on enhancing the visual design of the blocks by adding glossy effects 3-D shading, 
Sparkles gradient shading to make them look more polished and visually appealing. She also designed an implemented
The pink mode which introduced a custom pink theme animated glitter effects and a unique background music track
Which automatically plays when the pink mode is activated. She also created three ad banners
With a "cool girls code" theme. And implemented custom ad filtering logic so that when pink mode isn't able
Only those specific ads appear. With all other themes all add banners are displayed. She designed and styled the blocks
And Roman helped move them into the drawing factory class to help keep things clean and organized.
She also helped to refine the color scheme logic ensuring smooth transitions between themes. she also
Worked on optimizing the direction labels panel and game board panel layout for better readability 
along with Cleaning all check style warnings and magic numbers with Constance from style manager making
Overall code base cleaner and maintainable.
